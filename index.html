    <h1>Hello</h1>
	<!-- EW&F September -->
    <p><pre>
        Do you remember
        The 21st night of September?
        Love was changin' the minds of pretenders
        While chasin' the clouds away
        Our hearts were ringin'
        In the key that our souls were singin'
        As we danced in the night, remember
        How the stars stole the night away, oh, yeah
        Hey, hey, hey
        Ba-dee-ya, say, do you remember?
        Ba-dee-ya, dancin' in September
        Ba-dee-ya, never was a cloudy day
        Ba-du-da, ba-du-da, ba-du-da, ba-du
        Ba-du-da, ba-du, ba-du-da, ba-du
        Ba-du-da, ba-du, ba-du-da
        My thoughts are with you
        Holdin' hands with your heart to see you
        Only blue talk and love, remember
        How we knew love was here to stay
        Now December
        Found the love that we shared in September
        Only blue talk and love, remember
        The true love we share today
        Hey, hey, hey
        Ba-dee-ya, say, do you remember?
        Ba-dee-ya, dancin' in September
        Ba-dee-ya, never was a cloudy day
        There was a
        Ba-dee-ya (dee-ya, dee-ya), say, do you remember?
        Ba-dee-ya (dee-ya, dee-ya), dancin' in September
        Ba-dee-ya (dee-ya, dee-ya), golden dreams were shiny days
        The bell was ringin', oh, oh
        Our souls were singin'
        Do you remember never a cloudy day? Yow
        There was a
        Ba-dee-ya (dee-ya, dee-ya), say, do you remember?
        Ba-dee-ya (dee-ya, dee-ya), dancin' in September
        Ba-dee-ya (dee-ya, dee-ya), never was a cloudy day
        And we'll say
        Ba-dee-ya (dee-ya, dee-ya), say, do you remember?
        Ba-dee-ya (dee-ya, dee-ya), dancin' in September
        Ba-dee-ya (dee ya, dee-ya), golden dreams were shiny days
        Ba-dee-ya, dee-ya, dee-ya
        Ba-dee-ya, dee-ya, dee-ya
        Ba-dee-ya, dee-ya, dee-ya, dee-ya!
        Ba-dee-ya, dee-ya, dee-ya
        Ba-dee-ya, dee-ya, dee-ya
        Ba-dee-ya, dee-ya, dee-ya, dee-ya!
